# doodle
Doodle-My very own search engine just like google and we can search of things just like we expect on google and we can find results very similar to what we find on Google 
We can click on those links provided in the results and we can also see the decription below the link about what this website is talking about.
And if we scroll down we can see this pagination system which is identical to which we see on Google as well and if we click on a page it will show you the page you are on
Now if we scroll up we can also change our search to images and we crawl websites with these by using web-crawler in which we git it a website and it will go to all 
the links on that website and store them in a database 
It will also then go and get all the images on those websites and store links to those in the database too.
And that means that when I click on an image I can then view the image and I can view the page and when the image was found on. I can also see the captions too.
We have a site search for an image search I'll tell you how to use forms to submit data.
I load images using AJAX sockets 
I have used third party tools to display the gallery.
